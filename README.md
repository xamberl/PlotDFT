# PlotDFT
Plotting basic DFT data with Julia. Relies on Xtal.jl (https://github.com/brainandforce/Electrum.jl) for reading inputs and uses the Plots.jl package.

# Current features
* Plot total DOS from VASP.

# Planned features
* Plot projected, spin-polarized DOS.
* Plot band structures.
* Plot -pCOHP curves from LOBSTER.
* Plot phonon DOS and band structures.
