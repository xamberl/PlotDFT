# PlotDFT
Plotting basic DFT data with Julia. Relies on Xtal.jl (https://github.com/brainandforce/Xtal.jl) for reading inputs and uses the Plots.jl package.
Echoes implementation of features written for Pluto notebooks (https://github.com/xamberl/pluto-plotting), such that plots can be generated in the Julia REPL or in a code editor such as VS Code.

# Current features
* Plot total and projected DOS from VASP.

# Planned features
* Plot spin-polarized DOS.
* Plot band structures.
* Plot -pCOHP curves from LOBSTER.
